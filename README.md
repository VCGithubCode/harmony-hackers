## UX <a name="ux"></a>

### Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>
We want the app to display a note on the staff, and the user has to press the correct key on the keyboard. The app will provide instant feedback on whether the note is correct, helping users improve their note-reading skills through practice and repetition. Different difficulty levels will keep the learning engaging.


### Scope <a name="scope"></a>
We aim for the app to includes features that allow users to learn and practice recognizing musical notes displayed on a staff. Users will press the corresponding keys on a keyboard, receiving immediate feedback on their accuracy. The app will also offer various levels of difficulty and engaging practice modes to enhance the learning experience. Additional resources, such as tutorials and instructions, may be included to support users in developing their note-reading skills.

### Structure <a name="structure"></a>
The app's structure:

1. **Landing page:** The landing page serves as the introduction to the app, featuring a welcoming design. Users can easily access key features and see a prompt to start learning.

## Agile Development Process <a name="agile"></a>

**Agile Methodology**

Our project uses Agile methodology, which helps us adapt to changes and deliver work in small, manageable chunks, called sprints. This approach is great for staying flexible and responding quickly to new challenges in software development.

At the start of each sprint, we do sprint planning, where we: prioritise tasks from the product backlog, focusing on the most important ones, set clear goals for the sprint that align with our project milestones, assign tasks based on each team member's skills and availability.
Throughout the process, we balance scope, quality, time, and resources to deliver high-quality work efficiently. Agile keeps us focused and adaptable, ensuring we meet user needs while maintaining high standards.

We tracked progress daily using a simple Kanban board.es. Adopting Agile methodologies allows us to remain adaptable and focused, ensuring we meet user needs while striving for excellence.
These process were tracked daily using the basic Kanban board.

**Collaboration Tools** 

The team used Slack for quick communication and had two meetings a day to stay in sync. We also used GitHub Projects to track ideas, user stories, bugs, and our timeline.

We kept everyone updated on project progress and discussions by using the Slack team channel Canvas.
